💡 We're dedicated to maximizing your chances of being eligible for airdrops by integrating sybil-flag protection measures into our bot. Despite our best efforts, we urge you to remain cautious and adhere to the following advice:

⛓️ *Avoid Wallet Linking*: Never directly transfer funds between your wallets. Use an exchange, like Binance or OKX, as an intermediary. This prevents potential wallet-linking.

💰 *Maintain Network Balance*: Ensure a small amount of funds always remain in the network of your target airdrop. Wallets that appear empty may be flagged as Sybil.

🌐 *Engage with Popular Networks*: Stay active in major networks like Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. This conveys the impression of a genuine, protocol-diverse user.

🎁 *Diversify Airdrop Activity*: Don't focus exclusively on a single airdrop. Engage with various airdrops to showcase diverse blockchain activity.

🕰️ *Prolonged Usage & Diversified Airdrop Farming*: Utilize the bot over an extended period and refrain from farming all airdrops simultaneously across multiple wallets. Diverse and prolonged use appears more organic and less Sybil-like.

👛 *Unique Deposit Addresses*: Generate a unique Binance deposit address for each wallet when collecting airdrops. This prevents your wallets from being associated.

Happy airdrop farming, and remember to stay safu! 🚀
