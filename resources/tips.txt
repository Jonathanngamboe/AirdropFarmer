Here are some tips to help you make the most of your airdrop hunting experience while being aware of the risks involved:

1. 🚀 Engage actively: Complete tasks, join groups, and follow social media channels mentioned in airdrop campaigns. The more active you are, the better your chances of receiving rewards.

2. 📚 Do your research: Always research the projects behind airdrops to assess their legitimacy and potential. Be cautious of projects that seem too good to be true or lack substantial information.
